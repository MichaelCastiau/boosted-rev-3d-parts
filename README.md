# Boosted Rev Battery Replacement - Teardown and rebuild with custom 3D parts (WATERPROOF!)

This repository contains the downloadable files mentionned in my [blog post](https://michael-castiau.blogspot.com/2021/05/boosted-rev-battery-replacement.html).
These are all 3D printable casings that should be waterproof if printed and sealed correctly.

## Front Dashboard Lens

This part can be 3D printed in one piece, without supports (print front of the lens on the print bed). 
Filament or resin printed is supported. Please use a (semi) transparent material. Resin printing can give an especially nice look to this part.

The button of this part is printed within, no separate printing of the button is required.

## 3D Printable Battery Casing

**This casing is only compatible with max. 12S3P 18560 cells!**

The 3D printable casing is custom designed and if printed correctly should fit exactly inside your scooter. Use the downloadable `.stl` files to 3D print the casing or order it online. Print without supports.

> Note: the main part is 31 cm high so most 3D printing services will charge a lot of money to print it (even though it is hollow inside). Feel free to contact me if you want me to print the part for you, this will still be cheaper than a printing service

Parts are best printed in PETG, because it is waterproof, sturdy and a bit flexible, which should help when sliding the battery pack inside.

## Stormcore (or smaller VESC) Casing

This casing has a main part and a lid. The lid is screwed in place and can be sealed of with some silicone. There are holes for all necessary cables. Print with supports. Best material is PETG.
