# Boosted Rev Battery Replacement - Teardown and rebuild with custom 3D parts (WATERPROOF!)

This repository contains the downloadable files mentionned in my [blog post](https://michael-castiau.blogspot.com/2021/05/boosted-rev-battery-replacement.html).

I dissasembled and reassembled a Boosted Rev Battery with new cells. 

## Custom Balancing Wires PCB

If when dissasembling the pack, the yellow strip (flexible pcb) breaks, you'll have to order a custom PCB to re-solder the balancing wires and connect it to the BMS. Parts are all SMD, which can prove a little difficult to assemble if you lack soldering experience.

### How to order

Download the `Custom PCB Balacing Wires Production File.zip` from the repository and use that file to order the PCB at a manufacturing service. I usually use [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com), but any service will do. The PCB is a simple 2 layer SMD.

List of needed parts:

- 36 x LG INR18650HG2 Li-ion cells (at the time of writing difficult to find in the EU because of the COVID Pandemic)
- 3 x 10k@25Â°C 0805 SMD Thermistors
- 12 x 25A Resettable Fuse 1206 SMD (for custom PCB)
- 1 x 20 pin 0.5mm Hirose FPC Connector (for custom PCB)
- 1 x 20 pin FPC flat cable 25cm (for custom PCB)

## 3D Printable new Casing

The 3D printable casing is custom designed and if printed correctly should fit exactly inside your scooter. Use the downloadable `.stl` files to 3D print the casing or order it online. 

> Note: the main part is 31 cm high so most 3D printing services will charge a lot of money to print it (even though it is hollow inside). Feel free to contact me if you want me to print the part for you, this will still be cheaper than a printing service

Parts are best printed in PETG, because it is waterproof, sturdy and a bit flexible, which should help when sliding the battery pack inside.
