# Boosted Rev Custom 3D parts (WATERPROOF)

This repository contains the downloadable files mentionned in my [blog post](https://michael-castiau.blogspot.com/2021/05/boosted-rev-battery-replacement.html).
These are all 3D printable casings that should be waterproof if printed and sealed correctly.

## Front Dashboard Lens

This part can be 3D printed in one piece, without supports (print front of the lens on the print bed). 
Filament or resin printed is supported. Please use a (semi) transparent material. Resin printing can give an especially nice look to this part.

The button of this part is printed within, no separate printing of the button is required.

**Waterproofing: to waterproof the button, glue a small piece of rubber (like from a balloon) to the underside of the button with superglue. Let dry before use**
